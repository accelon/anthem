March of the Volunteers
Arise! ye who refuse to be bond slaves!
With our very flesh and blood, let us build our new Great Wall!
China‚Äôs masses have met the day of danger,
Indignation fills the heart of all of our countrymen.
Arise! Arise! Arise! 
Many hearts with one mind,
Brave the enemy‚Äôs gunfire, march on!

March on! March on! on!
^n2 My Homeland

A great river flows, its waves wide
Wind blows the scent of flowers to both shores
My family lives on the shore
I am used to hearing the punters' call
And seeing the white sails on the boats
This is the beautiful Motherland
This is the place where I grew up
On this expansive stretch of land
Everywhere there is wonderful scenery to behold
How flower-like are the young ladies
How big and brave are the hearts of the young men
In order to usher in a new era
They've woken the sleeping mountains
And changed the shape of the river
This is the heroic Motherland
This is the place where I grew up
On this stretch of ancient land
There is youthful vigor everywhere
Great mountains, great rivers, a great land
Every road is broad and wide
If friends come, there is fine wine
But if the wolves come
Those who greet them have hunting guns
This is the mighty Motherland
This is the place where I grew up
On this stretch of warm and friendly land
There is peaceful sunshine everywhere
^n3 My Motherland and I

Never can we be apart
my motherland and me
No matter where I travel
the hymn flows from me
To every mountain on thee
to every river that streams
Uprise the wind, small villages
where my heart rests in
My beloved land
my close memories
I lay my head in your breathing
You dear my faith treasure my dream
my motherland and me
Like the oceans wide
Like the waves in rows
I long for your embraces
I long for your strengths
Moments when you are smiling
All love ripples in me
I share your joys and your sadnesses
My dear mother country
You are the ocean full of lives
You send the waves and raise me high
Forever loving forever worthy
^n4 Republic of China

Three people's principles
The foundation of our party (The KMT).
Using this, we establish the Republic;
Using this, we advance into a state of total peace.
Oh, you, righteous men,
For the people, be the vanguard.
Without resting day or night,
Follow the Principles.
Swear to be diligent; swear to be courageous.
Obliged to be trustworthy; obliged to be loyal.
With one heart and one virtue,
We carry through until the very end...
^n5 Heir of the Dragon

In the Far East there is a river, 
its name is the Yangtze River
In the Far East there is a river, 
its name is the Yellow River
Although I‚Äôve never seen the beauty of the Yangtze, 
in my dreams I miraculously travel the Yangtze‚Äôs waters
Although I‚Äôve never heard the strength of the Yellow River, 
the rushing and surging waters are in my dreams
In the Ancient East there is a dragon, 
her name is China
In the Ancient East there is a people, 
they are all the heirs of the dragon
I grew up under the claw of the dragon, 
after I grew up I became an heir of the dragon
Black eyes, black hair, yellow skin, 
forever and ever an heir of the dragon
One hundred years ago on a tranquil night, 
in the deep of the night before enormous changes
Gun and cannon fire destroyed the tranquil night, 
surrounded on all sides by the appeasers' swords
How many years have gone by with the gunshots still ringing out, 
how many years followed by how many years
Mighty dragon, mighty dragon open your eyes, 
forever and ever open your eyes
^n6 Ode to the Republic of China

The grasslands of Qinghai cannot all be seen in one glance;
In the Himalayas, the peaks and peaks connect into the horizon.
Ancient saints and sages built a home here
That, through the howling wind and beating rain, stood for five thousand years.
Chorus:
Republic of China, Republic of China,
Withstands the test of time,
As long as the waters of the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers flow on,
Republic of China, Republic of China,
Will live on forever.
^n7 Go and Reclaim the Mainland

Go and reclaim, reclaim, reclaim the mainland;
Go and reclaim, reclaim, reclaim the mainland!
The mainland is our homeland, the mainland is our territory;
Our homeland, our territory;
We can't let the commies occupy it, we can't let the russkies bully it;
We must go back and reclaim it, we must go back and reclaim it;
Reclaim it, reclaim it;
Recover the mainland, recover the mainland!
^n8 China must be strong

China must be strong, China must be strong,
Behold our national hero:
China must be strong, China must be strong,
Behold the eight hundred warriors insisting on.
Fire and guns surrounding, Cruel wolves approaching.
Rather die than to yield,
Rather die than to kneel,
Our sacred banner was in foes' siege fluttering,
 flutter, fluttering!
Eight hundred men shared one will,
With valor they were filled.
Our action - gallant,
Our courage - so grand,
Compatriots, arise! Compatriots, arise!
Join the battlefield, fight like the warriors, fight!
China must be strong, China must be strong,
China must be strong, China must be strong,
Must be strong, must be strong, must be strong!
^n9 The Plum Blossom

Plum blossom, plum blossom all around the earth
The colder, the more it blossoms
The persistence of plum blossom symbolizes us
An honorable great China
Look at the plums over there, they are blooming
Wherever there is a land, there is a plum
Although there are ice, snow, wind and rain, it's not afraid of all of them
It's my national flower
Plum blossom, plum blossom all around the earth
The colder, the more it blossoms
The persistence of plum blossom symbolizes us
An honorable great China
Look at the plums over there, they are blooming
Wherever a land, there is a plum
Although there are ice, snow, wind and rain, it's not afraid of all of them
It's my national flower

The sea brims with turbulence.

May it lead from victory to victory!
^n3 Katyusha

Apple trees and pear trees blossomed,
Fogs started floating above the river.
Katyusha was going out onto the bank,
On the high bank and steep one.
She was going out and starting singing a song,
About a steppe glaucous eagle,
About the one who she loved,
About the one whose letters she was keeping.
Oh you, song, the girl's little song,
Fly after the bright sun:
And to the soldier at a faraway frontier
Send greetings from Katyusha.
Let him remember a simple girl,
And hear how she sings.
Let him protect the native land,
And Katyusha will save love.
Apple trees and pear trees blossomed,
Fogs started floating above the river.
Katyusha was going out onto the bank,
On the high bank and steep one.
^ck3„ÄîFrench Republic„Äï^n1


Arise, children of the Fatherland,
The day of glory has arrived!
Against us stands tyranny
Her bloody standard has been raised, (repeated)
Do you hear, in the countryside,
The roar of those ferocious soldiers?
They come right into your arms
To tear the throats of your sons, your wives!
Refrain:
ùÑÜ To arms, citizens,
Form your battalions,
Let's March, let's march!
So that an impure
blood waters our furrows! ùÑá

What does this horde of slaves
Of traitors and invented kings want?
For whom have these vile chains
These irons, been long prepared? (repeated)
Frenchmen, for us, ah! What outrage
What furious action it must arouse!
It is for us they dare plan
A return to the old slavery!

What! Foreign cohorts!
Would make the law in our homes!
What! These mercenary phalanxes
Would strike down our proud warriors! (repeated)
Great God! By chained hands
Our brows would yield under the yoke
Vile despots would themselves become
The masters of our destinies!

Tremble, tyrants and you traitors
The shame of all parties,
Tremble! Your parricidal schemes
Will finally receive their prize! (repeated)
Everyone is a soldier to combat you,
If they fall, our young heroes,
Will be produced anew from the ground,
Ready to fight against you!

Frenchmen, as magnanimous warriors,
Bear or hold back your blows!
Spare those sorry victims,
For regretfully arming against us (repeated)
But these bloodthirsty despots
These accomplices of Bouill√©
All these tigers who, mercilessly,
Tear apart their mother's breast!

Sacred love of the Fatherland,
Lead, support our avenging arms
Liberty, cherished Liberty
Fight with your defenders! (repeated)
Under our flags may victory
Hurry to your manly accents
So that your expiring enemies
See your triumph and our glory!
Children's verse:
We shall enter the (military) career
When our elders are no longer there
There we shall find their dust
And the trace of their virtues (repeated)
Much less keen to survive them
Than to share their coffins
We shall have the sublime pride
To avenge or follow them.
^ck4„ÄîUnited State of America„Äï^n1

‚Ö†
O say can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
‚Ö°
On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner, O long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
‚Ö¢
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,
A home and a country, should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
‚Ö£
O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation.
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: 'In God is our trust.'
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!
^n2 God Bless the U.S.A

If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life,
And I had to start again
with just my children and my wife,
I'd thank my lucky stars
to be living here today,
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom
and they can't take that away.
I'm proud to be an American
where at least I know I'm free,
And I won't forget the men who died
who gave that right to me,
And I gladly stand up next to you
and defend her still today,
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.
From the lakes of Minnesota
to the hills of Tennessee,
Across the plains of Texas
from sea to shining sea.
From Detroit down to Houston
and New York to L.A.,
There's pride in every American heart
and it's time we stand and say:
I'm proud to be an American
where at least I know I'm free,
And I won't forget the men who died

^n2 Patriotic March

Look above the eastern sea clearly dawns the sky;
Glorious and bright the sun rideth up on high.
Spirit pure of heaven and earth fills the hearts of all,
Hope abounding springs--O sweet Isles Imperial.
Yonder where the clouds of morn shed a radiant glow,
Fuji Mountain, Nippon's pride, rears its crown of snow.
Fair of form without a blot nobly doth it stand,
And unshakable--a true symbol of our land.
He who reigns above in power and in virtue dight,
Sovereign of unbroken line, is our changeless light.
We will follow--one and all loyal subjects, we--
Follow Him aright: fulfil our great destiny!
Onward, east, west, north and south. Over land and main!
Let us make the world our home, call to fellow-men
Everywhere on the four seas, let us build the tower
of just peace--let our ideal bloom forth like a flower!
Though again and yet again trials we may meet,
Over us may tempests roar, storms upon us beat,
Resolute in heart and mind justice we defend.
But one road we know to gain triumph in the end.
Hark! Far from the hallowed past of the Age Divine
Sounds our fathers' measured tread. O come fall in line!
As we, sons and daughters, march, shines our path before.
Glory be unto our land ever, evermore!

We are the imperial army and Our enemies are
The Emperor's enemies, forsaken by heaven and earth
The enemy's commander is one who
through history has no equal ‚Äî a hero
The soldiers who follow him are
United as fierce warriors ready to fight to the death
Though the wrathful deities shake their courage not
Heaven will not forgive their rebellion
Those who have risen up against us since olden times
Have never had their moment of glory
Until that time that our enemy is destroyed
Charge, charge, together as one
Drawing our swords, glistening like a broken jewel
We must charge forth, determined to die

Our divine nation's ways and the samurai's
Bodies were defended by the spirits
Though thrown away after the restoration
Our Japanese swords now and again may be carried
Again in our era, our reputation returned;
Enemy and ally together as one
Must die under the edge of the blade
And to those with the Japanese spirit
The time to die is now
Do not disgrace yourself with delay
Until that time that our enemy is destroyed
Charge, charge, together as one
Drawing our swords, glistening like a broken jewel
We must charge forth, determined to die
